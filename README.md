# Lab_Usage
A visualization in D3 of how the Middlebury College Computer Science Labs are used.

To run: Put the csv file and the html file in the same directory and run a simple python server.

To use: The line graph show how the labs are used from Midnight to Midnight. The red line shows people physically using the computer, the blue line shows people using computers for SSH and the orange line shows how computers are used during a selected day. To select a day, click on the specific bar of the bar graph. The bottom part of the page shows a heat map that is organized the same way as the computers are organized in the lab. The darker the color, more people are using it. Brushing on the brush changes the time duration for the whole visualization.
